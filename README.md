# MicTracker
MicTracker is a project as well as a software for automatic identification and tracking of migrating cells (OPCs) from 3D microscopic videos of live tissue including migrating cells (OPCs) and irrelevant non-migrating cells. It contains efforts to tackle exceptional difficulties in both segmentation and linking due to insufficient information.
